## File Structure in Supabase Storage

```
files/
├── warehouse/
│   ├── items/
│   │   ├── {itemNumber}_{timestamp}.{ext}  (images & PDFs)
│   ├── withdrawals/
│   │   ├── {orderNumber}_{timestamp}.pdf
│   └── dispense/
│       ├── {orderNumber}_{timestamp}.pdf
```

## Database Fields
- `imageUrl`: Stores Supabase Storage URL for item images
- `pdfbase64`: Stores Supabase Storage URL for PDF files (legacy field name kept for backward compatibility)

## Benefits
1. ✅ No more database bloat from base64 encoding
2. ✅ Faster page loads (images load separately)
3. ✅ Better performance for large files
4. ✅ Proper CDN delivery via Supabase Storage
5. ✅ Public URLs for easy sharing
6. ✅ Consistent file management across the application

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload item image → verify displays in table
- [ ] Upload item PDF → verify download works
- [ ] Edit item with new image → verify upload succeeds
- [ ] View item details → verify image displays
- [ ] Create withdrawal order with PDF → verify upload
- [ ] Edit dispense order with new PDF → verify upload
- [ ] Download PDF from withdrawal order → verify download
- [ ] Mobile view: test all image/PDF displays

## Notes
- All existing base64 data remains functional (backward compatible)
- New uploads use Supabase Storage exclusively
- File deletion is handled by Supabase Storage policies
- Images are served directly from Supabase CDN
